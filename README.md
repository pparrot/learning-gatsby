## Gatsby 

### What is Gatsby ? 

Gatsby is a [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)-based, [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/) powered, [static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/05/25/top-ten-static-site-generators-of-2017/). What does that even mean?  Well, it weaves together the best parts of React, [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/), [react-router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/core/guides/philosophy), **GraphQL**, and other front-end tools in to one very enjoyable developer experience. Don’t get hung up on the moniker ‘static site generator’.  That term has been around for a while, but Gatsby is far more like a modern front-end framework than a static site generator of old.

### Do I have to know React and GraphQL?

One of the biggest hurdles to someone trying out Gatsby is saying, “Well, I don’t know GraphQL”, or “I don’t know React and I really don’t have the time or energy to learn those just so I can try Gatsby.”  Fair enough, and as someone who knew React, but was intimidated by GraphQL, I put off learning Gatsby for way too long after first hearing about it.  But, I can confidently say that if you only know one or don’t know either of React and GraphQL, Gatsby is actually a great point of entry.  It has fantastic documentation and examples of React and GraphQL, and its structure lends itself to ‘thinking in React’ and ‘thinking in GraphQL’.
